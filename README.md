## 🎯 Overview

A sophisticated cold chain logistics system that combines **Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (VRPTW)** optimization with **autonomous real-time rerouting** to preserve product quality and minimize waste. The system monitors multi-compartment temperature conditions and makes intelligent routing decisions to prevent quality degradation.

### Key Features

- 🚚 **VRPTW Optimization** - Gurobi-powered route planning with time windows, capacity constraints, and risk minimization
- 🌡️ **Multi-Compartment Monitoring** - Track temperature and quality for different product types (dairy, produce, flowers)
- 🔄 **Autonomous Rerouting** - Real-time quality-preserving decisions (skip customers, return to depot, expedite delivery)
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** - Live route visualization, quality graphs, and performance metrics
- ⚡ **Time-Stepped Simulation** - Realistic modeling of temperature dynamics, delays, and reefer glitches

## 📊 Dashboard Features

The interactive Streamlit dashboard provides comprehensive monitoring and analysis:

### Real-Time Monitoring
1. **🗺️ Route Visualization** - Geographic map showing vehicle routes on India map (Medinipur district)
   - Color-coded routes per vehicle
   - Customer locations with city names
   - Hub/depot marked with star icon
   - Plotly Scattergeo for reliable rendering

2. **📈 Quality Degradation Tracking** - Per-vehicle and per-batch quality over time
   - Exponential decay visualization
   - Quality threshold indicators
   - Product-specific degradation curves

3. **🌡️ Temperature Monitoring** - Multi-compartment temperature profiles
   - Independent compartments (A: Dairy 3°C, B: Produce 12°C, C: Flowers 15°C)
   - Safe range visualization
   - Temperature excursion alerts

### Decision Intelligence

4. **🔄 Autonomous Reroute Timeline** - Complete decision history
   - Trigger events (temperature excursion, cumulative abuse, quality drop)
   - Options evaluated with scores
   - Final decision with economic impact

5. **📊 Performance Metrics Dashboard**
   - Fulfillment rate (customers served/total)
   - Average delivered quality
   - Total distance traveled
   - Economic summary (revenue, costs, profit)

### Analytics & Insights

6. **📉 Customer Fulfillment Status**
   - Delivered vs. abandoned customers
   - Quality at delivery with color coding (🟢 Good, 🟡 Acceptable, 🔴 Poor)
   - Reason for abandonment (quality preservation)

7. **🚚 Vehicle Summary Cards**
   - Final temperatures per compartment
   - Reroute triggers activated
   - Batches tracked
   - Total above-safe time
   - Cumulative abuse score

8. **⚙️ Interactive Configuration**
   - Adjustable simulation parameters in sidebar
   - Number of customers (5-20)
   - Fleet size (2-5 vehicles)
   - Vehicle capacity (10-30 units)
   - Quality threshold (40-90%)
   - Economic parameters (₹ revenue, spoilage costs)

## 🧠 How It Works

### 1. Route Planning (VRPTW)

The system uses Gurobi to solve a multi-objective VRPTW:

```python
minimize: α·distance + β·time + γ·risk
subject to:
  - Time window constraints
  - Vehicle capacity limits
  - Flow conservation
  - Subtour elimination
```

### 2. Quality Monitoring

Each batch is tracked with:
- **Above-safe time** - Minutes exceeding safe temperature range
- **Cumulative abuse** - Weighted temperature violations
- **Quality estimate** - Exponential decay based on exposure

Triggers for rerouting:
- Quality below threshold (60% default)
- Cumulative abuse exceeds limit
- Temperature out of safe range

### 3. Autonomous Rerouting

When quality degradation is detected, the system evaluates:

| Option | Description | When Used |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| **Skip Customer** | Bypass low-priority customer | Save time, ≤2 customers lost |
| **Return to Depot** | Abandon remaining stops | Emergency, ≤3 customers lost |
| **Expedite Delivery** | Increase speed (not implemented yet) | Minor delays |

Decision scoring:
```python
score = preserved_revenue - (lost_customers × avg_revenue) + (quality_gain × 1000)
```

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Temperature Model

Multi-compartment reefer units with:
- Independent setpoints per compartment (dairy: 3°C, produce: 12°C, flowers: 15°C)
- Leakage factor (heat ingress from ambient)
- Cooling power with stochastic variation
- Random glitch events (reefer failure)

### Quality Decay

Exponential decay model:
```python
quality(t) = exp(-k × cumulative_abuse)
where:
  k = product-specific decay constant
  cumulative_abuse = Σ(max(0, temp - safe_max) × dt)
```

### Routing Constraints

- **Time Windows**: Hard constraints on service start times
- **Capacity**: Multi-dimensional (by product type)
- **Service Time**: Loading/unloading delays
- **Travel Time**: Distance-based with speed factors
